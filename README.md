# Crawl

A simple web-crawler written in Java.

### Description

The program takes two command line arguments:
1. A URL as a starting point
2. num_hops, the number of hops to make from that URL

It hops to the first new and available URL found in the website's HTML file, and then it gathers the HTML file from that URL and repeats the process. It does this 'num_hops' times.
